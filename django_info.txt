#how website works

#when requesting something it will go to the ip address and
whatever is there it will show
#now, front end part will ghow GUI
#but backend part will give the complere idea about when 
and what to display when configure something

#so when request happens site will share it;s html,css and javascript
#but which and when to send that will only told by backend part

#tcpip
#a way to send the data, basically a site

#summary:#
#HTML,CSS and JS code can be viewed by the user whereas django code is kept secretly at the server side#
